# MathsOnlineHacks
Good Maths Online hacks, but has like 1 million different files bruh
Still in beta no offical setup guide but for devs:
# Dev Instructions
- Open how2run.txt
- Run the last command, it should be run in CMD. If it works chrome should open
- Copy the first 2 commands, put them in different cmd tabs and execute each, the ChatgptInput.py should attach to the browser and the server.py should be ready to receive the startOCR() function
- Log into MathsOnline (this does save but only for this chrome version, not on your main chrome), and go into your lesson of choice
- Paste the browserscript.js content into the console by going either ctrl + shift + j or right click -> Inspect element -> Console (you can naviate through the topbar)
Development in progress rn I think this is gonna be open source because the bums at MathsOnline too lazy to patch fr.
